<h1>Angular Crash Course</h1>
<h3>Following along with [Brad Traversy's Angular Crash Course] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8) to catch up on latest features of the Angular Library</h3>
---


<h3>What your application does</h3>
- This is a task manager. You can add and delete tasks that are saved
to a fake database. You can toggle the tasks to set a "reminder."
- This is just an example project. It doesn't set reminders or connect to 
your calendar. It is just a fancy list. 


<h3>Why you used the technologies you used</h3>
- I am trying to use Angular for a work project and thought the crash course would be useful. 

<h3>Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.</h3>
- There was a lot to take in. Things are done very differently but I was
able to break it down and understand how to go about getting things done. 
I am excited to play around with this more. 

<h3>What was your motivation?</h3>
- The current library I am using (AJS) is outdated. 

<h3>Why did you build this project?</h3>
- To get hands-on experience with Angular and learn the basics. 

<h3>What problem does it solve?</h3>
- Not knowing a thing about Angular vs AngularJs. 

<h3>What did you learn?</h3>
- I wrote out all of my notes in the notes.txt file. 

<h3>How to Install and Run the Project</h3>
- npm install -g @angular/cli
- download the folder
- cd into 'angular-cc'
- run ng run server in the terminal 
- open 'http://localhost:4200/' in your browser
