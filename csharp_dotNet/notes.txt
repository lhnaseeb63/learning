I have been put on the MOHE Website project. It uses asp and I am not sure 
if you use it purely with c# or if you can use it with JS. I'm not at 
all sure how to go about reading this code so I thought I would learn
the framework and then give it a gander so I have some idea how to 
navigate this. 

I am following along with Traversy's 
"Build a C# .NET Application in 60 Minutes" course:

What is C#?
- General purpose OO language
- Created by uSoft
- part of the many languages used with .NET
- relatively easy to learn

What is .NET?
- Framework for building Windows apps and web apps
- Not limited to C#
- Others include VB.net, F#, C++/CLI, etc. 
- Consists of CLr (Common Language Runtime) & Class Library 

What is CLR?
- Common Language Runtime
- Virtual Machine component
- Manages execution of programs
     --> provides an environment for our applications to Run
- JIT (Just In Time) converts compiled code into machine instructions
- Also includes things like memory and thread management
- All .NET programs are executed by CLR
