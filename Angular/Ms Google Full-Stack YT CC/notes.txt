Going to:
- Write some front end
- NodeJS server tied in with MySQL dB
- how to host site on google cloud 

- How to create routing between components
- Going to have a general listings page then a MY listings page
- go to app.routing.ts 
    --> const routes: Routes = [];
    --> Need to add an object for every route that our app needs
        --> path: 'url you want component to be displayed at'
        --> component: which component you want to have displayed at that route
            --> Have to import it into the file
        --> pathMatch: 'full'
            --> we are going to have routes where you pass in :id in the path. 
            the 'full' is to prevent the page from being redirected to the 
            page without a path. 
            -->  { path: 'listings', component:ListingsPageComponent, pathMatch: 'full' },
                 { path: 'listings/:id', component:ListingDetailPageComponent },
