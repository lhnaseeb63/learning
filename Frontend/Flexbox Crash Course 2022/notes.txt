Known as flexible box model. 1 dimensional
Grid for overall layout of page
flexbox for inner elements
flex container is the element that holds flex items
flex items are direct children of the flex container

Flex container properties:
flex-direction
flex-wrap
flex-flow
justify-content, main axis
align-items, cross axis
align-content

Flex Item Properties:
order
flex-grow
flex-shrink
flex-basis
align-self

Order: you can set the order of items by using order: number. Super cool!

width: 
flex-basis--> width of box when it starts out
flex-grow--> default is zero, factor of flex element's main size,
 think of it as growth rate, 1,2,3, etc. 
flex-shrink --> shrink at different rates
flex: grow shrink basis --> all lot of the time we won't have a flex basis
 if we want all of the items to have the same width and space can use the 
 short-hand flex:1
